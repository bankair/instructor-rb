Dive into the world of Ruby-based structured extraction, by OpenAI's function calling API, ruby-first schema validation with type inference. Instructor stands out for its simplicity, transparency, and user-centric design. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, you'll find Instructor's approach intuitive and steerable.

Instructor-rb is a Ruby library that makes it a breeze to work with structured outputs from large language models (LLMs). Built on top of [EasyTalk](https://github.com/sergiobayona/easy_talk), it provides a simple, transparent, and user-friendly API to manage validation, retries, and streaming responses. Get ready to supercharge your LLM workflows!

# Getting Started

  1. Install Instructor-rb at the command prompt if you haven't yet:
  
        ```bash
        $ gem install instructor-rb
        ```

  2. In your Ruby project, require the gem:

        ```ruby
        require 'instructor'
        ```

  3. At the beginning of your script, initialize and patch the OpenAI client:

        ```ruby
        client = Instructor.patch(OpenAI::Client)
        ```

## Usage

export your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Then use Instructor by defining your schema in Ruby using the `define_schema` block and [EasyTalk](https://github.com/sergiobayona/easy_talk)'s schema definition syntax. Here's an example in:

```ruby
require 'instructor'

class UserDetail
  include EasyTalk::Model

  define_schema do
    property :name, String
    property :age, Integer
  end
end

client = Instructor.patch(OpenAI::Client).new

user = client.chat(
  parameters: {
    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Extract Jason is 25 years old' }]
  },
  response_model: UserDetail
)

user.name # => "Jason"
user.age # => 25
```
