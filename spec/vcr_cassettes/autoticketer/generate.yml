        for the following transcript: Alice: Hey team, we have several critical tasks
        we need to tackle for the upcoming release. First, we need to work on improving
        the authentication system. It''s a top priority.\n\nBob: Got it, Alice. I
        can take the lead on the authentication improvements. Are there any specific
        areas you want me to focus on?\n\nAlice: Good question, Bob. We need both
        a front-end revamp and back-end optimization. So basically, two sub-tasks.\n\nCarol:
        I can help with the front-end part of the authentication system.\n\nBob: Great,
        Carol. I''ll handle the back-end optimization then.\n\nAlice: Perfect. Now,
        after the authentication system is improved, we have to integrate it with
        our new billing system. That''s a medium priority task.\n\nCarol: Is the new
        billing system already in place?\n\nAlice: No, it''s actually another task.
        So it''s a dependency for the integration task. Bob, can you also handle the
        billing system?\n\nBob: Sure, but I''ll need to complete the back-end optimization
        of the authentication system first, so it''s dependent on that.\n\nAlice:
        Understood. Lastly, we also need to update our user documentation to reflect
        all these changes. It''s a low-priority task but still important.\n\nCarol:
        I can take that on once the front-end changes for the authentication system
        are done. So, it would be dependent on that.\n\nAlice: Sounds like a plan.
        Let''s get these tasks modeled out and get started.\n"}],"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"Actionitems","description":"Correctly
